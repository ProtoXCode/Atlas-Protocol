# Atlas Protocol Blueprint Module: Torque Requirement Toolchain

## Overview

This module introduces a logic layer that links fastener torque specifications, structural joint constraints, and assembly tooling into a seamless intent-driven system. The goal is to enable the Atlas digital twin to infer and inject tool requirements directly into the BOM based on the specific forces, materials, and access constraints of a part or assembly.

---

## Intent

To ensure that:

* All fasteners are applied with the correct torque settings
* Connected components are not under- or over-torqued relative to structural limits
* The required tooling is automatically determined and included in the digital twin's BOM
* Installation feasibility is guaranteed with respect to geometry, accessibility, and tool capabilities
* For factories implementing full digital twin functionality, torque tools adjust per fastener and sync with the twin in real-time

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Fastener Metadata Extension**

* Each fastener includes:

  * Min/Max torque value (in Nm)
  * Fastener grade/class (e.g. 8.8, A4, etc.)
  * Head type (to determine compatible tool types)
  * Tool clearance geometry

### 2. **Structural Constraint Awareness**

* Atlas evaluates the materials and geometry of the parts being joined
* Compares them to torque limits to ensure no crushing, yielding, or thread stripping will occur
* Structural logic module cross-checks bolt preload vs. part stiffness and shear resistance

### 3. **Tool Suggestion Logic**

* Based on torque requirement, joint access, and fastener head type, Atlas selects:

  * Appropriate torque wrench / driver
  * Drive bit or socket
  * Installation method (manual, power tool, robot)
* Result is mapped into the BOM with reference to tool database (standard or custom)

---

## Assembly Feasibility Integration

* Temporary toolspace constraints (from the fastener logic module) are used to validate:

  * Wrench swing radius
  * Tool body length
  * Operator hand or robotic actuator clearance
* Tool selection can influence fastener orientation in early design

---

## BOM Interaction

* Tools are tagged as "install-phase components"
* BOM export includes installation logic tree:

  * Fastener ID → Torque → Tool → Clearance OK → Add to BOM
* Optional: flag tools as company-owned, rental, or purchase required

---

## Twin Benefits

* Realistic, install-ready BOMs
* Reduced tooling errors
* Unified fastener-tool-structure thinking
* Enables future AI install optimization modules
* For advanced factories, tool usage and torque confirmation data can sync with the digital twin, validating correct procedure step-by-step

---

## Future Enhancements

* Smart clustering of similar torque specs to reduce tool count
* Integration with tool inventory systems
* Predictive tool wear tracking for maintenance routines

---

## Final Thought

This module teaches the twin not just how to bolt parts together, but *how to think like the person (or robot) holding the wrench*. It bridges digital and physical assembly with the grace of true intent logic.
