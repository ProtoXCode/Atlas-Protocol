# Atlas Protocol Blueprint Module: Reactive Design

## Overview
Reactive Design is the foundational design principle of Atlas Protocol. It defines a system where parts, assemblies, and logic trees automatically respond to constraint changes, version updates, and ripple effects — creating a dynamic, logic-first design environment.

## Intent
To enable self-updating, constraint-bound systems that adapt in real time to internal or external changes without breaking design intent or structural integrity.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Design as Logic Tree
Every part is defined not by static geometry, but by:
- Intent
- Constraints
- Relationships
- Dependencies

These are versioned and validated automatically.

### 2. Bidirectional Dependency Awareness
Parts don’t just exist — they *know*:
- What they depend on
- What depends on them
- What their tolerances and boundaries are

### 3. Ripple Propagation (via BOMBE)
If one part changes:
- All connected parts are evaluated
- Geometry is updated within limits
- Errors are flagged if constraints can't be resolved

### 4. Soft Failure & Override
If an update violates design intent:
- System flags the constraint
- Suggests alternatives
- Allows override (exec-level decision)
- Logs change via Enigma

### 5. Live Model Recalculation
When running in memory or inside a twin:
- Changes are instantly applied
- Updates propagate outward
- The system reaches new equilibrium or halts if blocked

## Example Use Case
A mounting bracket is moved 10mm:
- Connected bolt hole adjusts
- Clearance with panel is rechecked
- Fastener torque recalculated
- CAM file regenerated
- ERP record updated
- BOM flags two dependent subassemblies for review

---

## Benefits
- Zero ambiguity
- Full traceability
- Design resilience
- Intent preservation
- Reduced manual rework

---

## Final Thought
Reactive Design flips design on its head.  
Parts are not independent guesses — they are **living, logic-bound consequences.**  
Atlas doesn’t redraw. It **resolves.**
