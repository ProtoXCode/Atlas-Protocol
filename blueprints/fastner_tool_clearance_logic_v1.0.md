# Atlas Protocol Blueprint Module: Fastener Tool Clearance Logic

## Overview
This module defines a logic layer for integrating **temporary spatial constraints** during the assembly phase of a part or system, specifically for fasteners. These constraints ensure adequate space for tools, hands, or robotic access during installation, without causing constraint conflicts once the fastener is installed.

---

## Intent
To simulate and validate real-world assembly requirements within the digital twin, ensuring all fasteners are installable with correct clearances, without compromising post-installation design integrity.

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Temporary Mounting Constraints**
- Added to fastener locations (bolts, screws, nuts, etc.)
- Define required access envelope for installation tools (e.g. spanner radius, driver length, hand clearance)
- Marked as `temporary`

### 2. **Post-Install Resolution**
- Once fastener is considered installed, temporary constraint is flagged for removal
- Allows overhanging parts or tight envelopes to be modeled after installation

### 3. **Constraint Types**
- **Drop-in only** (e.g. bolt slots through hole)
- **Wrench required** (requires space around head or nut)
- **Torque tool** (larger offset volume needed)
- **Robotic grip** (precision constraints, collision check for toolpath)

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Input Parameters
- Fastener type (linked to standard tooling profile)
- Position & axis
- Installation access method (hand, tool, robot)

### Logic Flow
1. Place fastener
2. Add temporary tool envelope constraint
3. Twin validates geometry for installation clearance
4. Flag constraint as temporary
5. After installation step in simulation, remove or deactivate constraint
6. Validate ripple if subsequent part enters previous constraint zone

---

## ERP & BOM Integration
- Fastener metadata expanded with install-type
- BOM can optionally include install-phase notes or tool requirements
- Stock logic adapts based on accessibility levels (e.g. use accessible variant if tool-clearance violated)

---

## Twin Benefits
- Early detection of unreachable fasteners
- No post-assembly collisions
- Enables design-for-maintainability audits

---

## Potential Enhancements
- Auto-select fasteners based on clearance profile
- AI-based conflict prediction from historical installs
- Assembly animation sequences respecting constraints

---

## Final Thought
This logic isn’t just about bolts. It’s about **teaching the twin to respect the human (or machine) who puts it together.**
