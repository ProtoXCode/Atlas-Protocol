# Atlas Protocol Blueprint Module: BOM Standardization & Cleanup

## Overview
This module defines the logic for cleaning and standardizing existing ERP part libraries based on geometric and functional similarity. It reduces unnecessary part proliferation, optimizes BOMs, and enables consistent reuse across the system.

---

## Intent
To reduce part duplication and variation, improve procurement efficiency, and enhance system-wide modularity by detecting and consolidating interchangeable components.

---

## Module: Existing BOM / ERP Cleanup Logic

### 1. **Scan & Classify Parts**
- Loop through existing ERP part database
- Categorize parts by:
  - Geometry (bounding box, hole positions, features)
  - Function (role within assembly, load class, material)
  - Compatibility (min/max constraint tolerance)

### 2. **Detect Overlaps**
- Identify parts that serve the same function but differ in:
  - Non-critical dimensions (e.g. 3mm difference in length)
  - Mounting style (if interchangeable)
- Apply rules:
  - Prefer smaller part if fits all known roles
  - Favor in-stock variants

### 3. **Output Cleanup Suggestions**
- Map candidates to replacement part
- Output proposed consolidation list with usage frequency
- Optional: auto-tag deprecated parts for archive/freeze

---

## ERP & Twin Integration
- Cleaned part library syncs back to ERP
- Consolidated part logic informs new design reuse logic

---

## Twin Benefits
- Smaller part catalog
- Increased reuse = reduced design and procurement effort
- Lower part variety = cost reduction in tooling, sourcing, and QA
- Automatically avoids “almost identical” part clutter

---

## Potential Enhancements
- Machine learning scoring of part similarity
- Visual part clustering for engineer review
- Smart tagging of reused parts for maintenance traceability

---

## Final Thought
A lean BOM is a powerful BOM. Atlas makes part consolidation a core logic discipline, not a post-production regret.
