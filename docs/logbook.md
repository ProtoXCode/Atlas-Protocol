# ðŸ§­ ATLAS PROTOCOL â€“ BUILD LOGBOOK

This is the living logbook for the construction of the Atlas Protocol.
It documents the ideas, breakthroughs, and phases of development from inception.

---

### ðŸ“… 2025-08-11 â€“ Linux Wrapper
 - Linux Wrapper
   - A lot of debugging to find the culprit, but finally it works on Linux.
   - The wrapper is now included in the repo.
   - Compile the rest of the files using the script in tools.
 - Added "how to run" on README.
---

### ðŸ“… 2025-08-10 â€“ Wrapper Semantics
 - Updated functions in the wrapper, fixed rotation, added api version.
 - Added tests.
 - Reworked how model data is returned.
   - Model returns list of shapes.
   - Viewer converts to mesh and renders.
   - Should be able to pull more functions out of the model now.

---

### ðŸ“… 2025-08-09 â€“ Linux attempt #1
Trying to get it to work on Linux:
 - Issue with how to start up PySide6, it at least now runs on Fedora, but only the GUI alone.
 - Dependencies made a lot of issues, removed the files, added a setup script that clones, builds and sets up the wrapper paths using pathelf.
 - Still issue with SegFault, might be ABI mismatch, linking things not needed etc. My trusty sidekick had lots of ideas.
 - Added some PyTests:
   - Issues with rotate.
   - Make compound needs to throw exception when no model added.
 - Added logging.

---

### ðŸ“… 2025-08-08 â€“ Model menu & cleanup
- Adding model menu options into the model itself.
  - Rebuilds GUI with controls from model file.
  - Updates on the fly.
- Cleanup / Removed:
  - Removed the old TK code, PySide6 is the way.
  - Bombe / Ripple resolver... Simplified out of existence?
  - Enigma / Versioning -> GIT!
  - Titan, scale is hopefully not a problem anymore with the new concept.

---

### ðŸ“… 2025-08-07 â€“ Rendering Mesh
- GUI looks a lot better now, added styling.
- ComboBox scans the model folder and updates the list.

---

### ðŸ“… 2025-08-06 â€“ Rendering Mesh
ðŸš€ **Milestone unlocked!**
- Added a simple box shape model.
- Removed the stl and stp files, no longer needed.
- Replaced the stl file viewer with a render_mesh function, now displays the model directly to the VTK viewer.

---

### ðŸ“… 2025-08-05 â€“ winx_x64 runtime
- Copied over the remainder of the OCC dll files, it's a bit redundant, some of them might not be needed, but I haven't eliminated those who are not needed yet. They don't directly take up too mich space.
- I might move the dll's over as a separate download and provide a script to generate them, but for now the compiled files are ready to use.
- Included the first public version of my wrapper, the included pyi file should make use of it understandable.
- Added functionality into the wrapper to display mesh, not tested yet, but should make the models renderable in VTK.
- Linux runtime files and wrapper exists, not uploaded yet since things change constantly, but could be upped if needed.
- Still learning C++, 400 pages into Crash Course. Some stuff clicks, other things are still a big mystery.

---

### ðŸ“… 2025-06-17 â€“ Wrapper Work
- Added several new features to the wrapper:
  - Triangle wire shape
  - Square wire shape
  - Cylinder
  - Cut
  - Fuse
  - Translate

It *compiles*, and I'm close to the minimum specs for an MVP.

---

### ðŸ“… 2025-06-16 â€“ Memory Usage Info
- Added memory usage information in the viewer.

---

### ðŸ“… 2025-06-10 â€“ STEP File Generation ðŸŽ‰
- ðŸš€ **Milestone unlocked:** First successful build and execution of my custom OpenCascade Python wrapper â€” *no Conda, no bloat*.
- âœ… **Fully working:**  
  - `make_box()` â€“ creates a basic 3D box shape  
  - `export_step()` â€“ exports it cleanly as a `.step` file

- ðŸ”§ **Built using:**  
  - Pybind11  
  - CMake + Ninja  
  - vcpkg-managed OpenCascade  
  - Manually curated DLL runtime (Windows)

- ðŸ§  **Why this matters:**  
  - Minimal, fast, and lean â€” designed for automation and intent-driven CAD, not GUI-heavy legacy tooling.
  - The engine behind future Atlas Protocol CAD generation is now real â€” and it works.

**ðŸ—‚ Status:** Wrapper is real, box is built, STEP file exported.  
Next: More shapes, more power, and full Atlas integration.

---

### ðŸ“… 2025-06-05 â€“ GUI Refactor
- Switched to Pyside6 since VTK didn't support Tkinter.
  - Loaded and rendered a STL file.
- Reversed this log. New entry on top.

---

### ðŸ“… 2025-05-17 â€“ Folder restructure
- Moved blueprints into docs folder.
  - Legacy_blueprints into blueprints.
- New folder: idea_oasis - Where misc ideas is added:
  - Added idea for memory management by reversing the file.

---

### ðŸ“… 2025-05-12 â€“ GUI work
- Added another row, dropdown selector for models.
- Long days at work this week at the factory due to Lean/5S corse. 12h days.

---

### ðŸ“… 2025-05-11 â€“ Project concept almost complete
- **Project progress: (Concept is 90%-ish done)**
  - GUI layout and function flow.
  - Viewer interaction model.
  - Part module logic.
  - Export pipelines.
- Updated docs:
  - LICENSE: Updated to v1.1. Refined commercial use part.
  - README: Fixed link to license.
- First *code*:
  - main.py with layout.
  - Added requirements.txt.

---

### ðŸ“… 2025-05-07 â€“ That's a lot of text | Too many ideas
- **Spatial logic breakthrough:***
  - Anchor-based placement replace CAD constraints.
  - Thread-safe, loopable part generation - order no longer matters.
  - Simplified geometry, placement and part constructions.
- Archive recovery operation:
  - Recovered and cleaned **36 new blueprint fragments***.
  - Merged and categorized for future drops.
- Blueprint upgrades:
  - Gauntlet â†’ v2.0.
    - v1.0 archived.
  - Caladan â†’ v1.1 *(clarity pass, same logic)*.
     - v1.0 archived
  - New: **examples_intent_logic**
- Mapped out the logic layer and experience core for an editor.

---

### ðŸ“… 2025-05-06 â€“ Too many new ideas / BHC side project
- Opportunity to look at a possibility to compress STEP files.
  - Created full folder structure for BHC repo.
  - Built `compress_to_atlas()` and wired it into CLI and API.
    - Must finish compressor. Let's hope it works, it's *unusual*.
  - Implemented Transfer Portal: Upload STEP â†’ Get .atlas
  - STL Resurrection concept locked in.
  - Built `.atlas` file structure + hash verification spec.
  - Viewer concept scoped: show logic is real, not black box magic.
  - Might look at other file types for same compression if successful.
- STL to STEP conversion possibility. Will look into later.
- Realized that there could be missing data on some of the blueprints, need to check and update.
- Estimated dev time from a 4-5 dev team 9-12 months down to 6-8 weeks solo for core MVP due to keystone blueprints, impressive.

---

### ðŸ“… 2025-05-05 â€“ Project planning
- Concepted viewer GUI, must choose demo item:
  - Transformer (Time consuming, but very straight forward)
  - Door (Simple and easy, boring though)
  - Donkey Cart?

---

### ðŸ“… 2025-05-03â€“04 â€“ Keystone ideas
- Defined how constraints flow between subsystems.
- The idea of **co-design across teams and geos** becomes native.
- Potential massive resource reduction in Atlas, potato compatible?

---

### ðŸ“… 2025-05-04 â€“ Mini AI path
- AI logic, purpose built AI's with logic layer. AI â†’ Logic/Intent â†’ AI.

---

### ðŸ“… 2025-05-02 â€“ Caladan Named and Framed
- Caladan defined as the planetary-scale runtime state engine.
- Introduced ripple-based constraint propagation as a living environment concept.
- Logic-first twins enter scope: machines, assemblies, data flows.

---

### ðŸ“… 2025-05-01 â€“ Core System Mapped
- Sketched the modular architecture of Atlas:
  - Titan â€“ Master logic resolver
  - Keystone â€“ Constraint manager
  - Relay â€“ Comms and transport
- Recognized that design intent is **compressible**.
- Identified need for custom logic encoder.

---

### ðŸ“… 2025-04-30 â€“ The Atlas Idea is Born
- Started working with the idea to automate parts using Python.
- Since all data is known of entire item, why not automate all of it?
- Initial concept: What if we started from **design intent**, not geometry?

---

This log will be continuously updated as Atlas expands.
