# ðŸ§­ ATLAS PROTOCOL â€“ BUILD LOGBOOK

This is the living logbook for the construction of the Atlas Protocol.
It documents the ideas, breakthroughs, and phases of development from inception.

---

### ðŸ“… 2024-04-30 â€“ The Atlas Idea is Born
- Started working with the idea to automate parts using Python.
- Since all data is known of entire item, why not automate all of it?
- Initial concept: What if we started from **design intent**, not geometry?

---

### ðŸ“… 2024-05-01 â€“ Core System Mapped
- Sketched the modular architecture of Atlas:
  - Titan â€“ Master logic resolver
  - Keystone â€“ Constraint manager
  - Relay â€“ Comms and transport
- Recognized that design intent is **compressible**.
- Identified need for custom logic encoder.

---

### ðŸ“… 2024-05-02 â€“ Caladan Named and Framed
- Caladan defined as the planetary-scale runtime state engine.
- Introduced ripple-based constraint propagation as a living environment concept.
- Logic-first twins enter scope: machines, assemblies, data flows.

---

### ðŸ“… 2024-05-04 â€“ Mini AI path
- AI logic, purpose built AI's with logic layer. AI -> Logic/Intent -> AI.

---

### ðŸ“… 2024-05-03â€“04 â€“ Keystone ideas
- Defined how constraints flow between subsystems.
- The idea of **co-design across teams and geos** becomes native.
- Potential massive resource reduction in Atlas, potato compatible?

---

### ðŸ“… 2024-05-05 â€“ Project planning
- Concepted viewer GUI, must choose demo item:
  - Transformer (Time consuming, but very straight forward)
  - Door (Simple and easy, boring though)
  - Donkey Cart?

---

### ðŸ“… 2024-05-06 â€“ Too many new ideas / BHC side project
- Oppurtunity to look at a possibility to compress STEP files.
  - Created full folder structure for BHC repo.
  - Built `compress_to_atlas()` and wired it into CLI and API.
    - Must finish compressor. Let's hope it works, it's *unusual*.
  - Implemented Transfer Portal: Upload STEP â†’ Get .atlas
  - STL Resurrection concept locked in.
  - Built `.atlas` file structure + hash verification spec.
  - Viewer concept scoped: show logic is real, not black box magic.
  - Might look at other file types for same compression if successful.
- STL to STEP conversion possibility. Will look into later.
- Realized that there could be missing data on some of the blueprints, need to check and update.
- Estimated dev time from a 4-5 dev team 9-12 months down to 6-8 weeks solo for core MVP due to keystone blueprints, impressive.

This log will be continuously updated as Atlas expands.
