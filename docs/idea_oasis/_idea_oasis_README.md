# Idea Oasis

**Welcome to the idea oasis in the desert of logic.**

This is the part of the Atlas Protocol where raw thoughts, unfiltered concepts, and system-shifting brain sparks come to rest.

## What is this?

A sandbox. A brain spill zone.  
Here I collect:

- Protocol fragments  
- Memory rituals  
- Resolver wormholes  
- Unverified blueprints  
- Engineering hypotheticals  
- Random sentences that start with "What if..."

## Why does this exist?

Because innovation doesnâ€™t always show up with a pull request and a test suite.  
Sometimes it starts with a **dumb sketch at 2AM** that turns into a protocol handler six months later.

This folder is where Atlas gets a little weird, a little brilliant, and a little unhinged.
