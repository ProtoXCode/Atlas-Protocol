# Atlas Protocol Blueprint Module: BOMBE ‚Äì Ripple Logic Engine

## Overview
BOMBE is the ripple logic engine within Atlas Protocol. It monitors constraint changes, design updates, part substitutions, and other modifications, and propagates those changes through dependent systems, triggering validations, conflict resolutions, or rollback proposals.

BOMBE ensures every design decision is **traceable, explainable, and structurally aware** ‚Äî even as it travels through complex assemblies.

---

## Intent
To enforce system-wide integrity by simulating the *ripple effects* of a change before it breaks reality ‚Äî and giving designers and engineers tools to trace, contain, or embrace those ripples with full clarity.

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. Ripple Origin Detection
- Any modification to:
  - Geometry
  - Constraints
  - Part position
  - Material properties
  - External loads
- Is detected as a **ripple origin**

```yaml
ripple_origin:
  part_id: cooling_lid_v4
  change: moved_hole[2] by 3mm
  reason: bolt torque misalignment
```

---

### 2. Dependency Graph Resolution
- BOMBE queries connected parts and systems via:
  - Enigma version history
  - Geometric constraint trees
  - Shared mounting/facing logic
  - Bolt and interface logic
- Propagation path is automatically computed

```yaml
ripple_path:
  - part: core_support
    conflict: bolt_path misaligned
  - part: enclosure_mount
    status: unaffected
  - part: interface_panel
    action_required: hole reposition or override
```

---

### 3. Ripple Response Types
- For each affected part or constraint:
  - ‚úÖ Auto-adjust (within allowed tolerance)
  - ‚ö† Requires negotiation (multiple valid solutions)
  - ‚ùå Conflict (manual resolution needed)
  - üîí Locked zone (not allowed to ripple into)

---

### 4. Executive Override Layer
- Critical ripple blocks can be overridden by authorized personnel
- All overrides are logged in Enigma

```yaml
override:
  part: panel_interface
  reason: urgency
  approved_by: CTO
  ripple_forced: true
  notes: "Temporary fix until bracket redesign complete"
```

---

### 5. Simulation Trigger
- BOMBE can trigger re-simulation:
  - Load testing
  - Tool clearance
  - Heat distribution
- After ripple settles, system re-validates design logic

---

## Twin Benefits
- No silent breakages ‚Äî every change is structurally evaluated
- Enables deep version tracking of *why* things changed
- Ensures systems evolve with constraint integrity intact
- Supports negotiation between competing design goals

---

## Potential Enhancements
- Visual ripple propagation map
- AI ripple suggestion engine (‚Äúbest path to resolve‚Äù)
- Multi-branch ripple testing (see: Gauntlet)
- Time-based ripple watch (delayed propagation)

---

## Final Thought
BOMBE turns change from chaos into choreography. In a ripple-aware world, *nothing breaks silently ‚Äî and everything explains itself.*
