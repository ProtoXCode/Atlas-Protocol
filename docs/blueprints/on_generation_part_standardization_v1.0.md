# Atlas Protocol Blueprint Module: On-Generation Part Standardization

## Overview
This module defines the logic for enforcing dimensional and functional standardization during the part generation phase. It ensures that newly created parts align with established part families, stock dimensions, and system constraints — minimizing unnecessary variation at creation.

---

## Intent
To ensure that all new parts generated by the twin system follow standardized constraints, leverage existing inventory where possible, and support long-term modularity and reuse.

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Constraint-Aware Snapping**
- When generating new parts, apply rule-based snapping to dimensions:
  - Round lengths to nearest 25mm or preferred increment
  - Apply positive rounding bias where structural margin allows
  - Avoid interference with constraint boundaries (e.g. walls, edge clearance)

### 2. **Use-Case Anchoring**
- Tag each new part with intent metadata:
  - Structural role (e.g. cover, bracket, support)
  - Expected forces, mounting type, thermal/load conditions
  - Minimum/maximum permissible dimension range

### 3. **Search for Reusable Parts Before Generation**
- Before generating a new part, check:
  - Does a part already exist that meets or exceeds constraints?
  - If yes → reuse existing part
  - If no → generate new part, and catalog it with future reuse in mind

## ERP & Twin Integration
- Newly generated parts are standardized by design
- Twin may prioritize part usage by availability, stock level, and standard family

---

## Twin Benefits
- Consistent part shapes and sizing
- Part reuse = reduced inventory, faster production
- Smarter BOMs with fewer unique items
- Standard-driven output from the start

---

## Potential Enhancements
- Integration with real-time stock levels
- Dynamic constraint snapping based on twin state
- Smart ruleset management for part category families

---

## Final Thought
Standardization isn’t a limiter — it’s a multiplier. With Atlas, part reuse becomes the natural consequence of good intent coding.
