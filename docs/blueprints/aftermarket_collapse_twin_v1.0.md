# Atlas Protocol Blueprint Module: ACT – Aftermarket Collapse Twin

## Overview
ACT (Aftermarket Collapse Twin) enables post-failure reconstruction of digital twins using Atlas' logic-first model. It identifies root cause through constraint simulation, ripple propagation, and versioned logic tracing. Only the initial hypothesis layer uses AI — all validation is deterministic and reproducible.

---

## Intent
To reconstruct failed systems using available data (BOM, materials, logs), simulate failure propagation, and pinpoint the originating deviation within twin logic. Enables factual, auditable postmortems.

---

## Core Components
- **Enigma:** Reconstructs historical intent trail
- **Caladan:** Verifies material origin and substitution risk
- **BOMBE:** Traces ripple effects from hypothesized breach
- **Gauntlet:** Runs stress/load scenarios to confirm failure alignment
- **FailureAI:** Suggests most likely breach zones (scoped, optional)
- **Constraint Logic Engine:** Validates actual vs intended specs

## Use Case Example – Bolt-Induced Structural Collapse

### Context:
A heavy transformer support bracket failed during normal operation. Field inspection shows distortion near bolt mount but no obvious overload elsewhere.

### Step 1: Twin Synthesis from BOM
```yaml
component: SupportBracket_XY
fastener:
  id: B-72xM12
  spec:
    length: 80mm
    grade: 10.9
    torque_spec: 95Nm
    head_type: hex
```

### Step 2: AI Hypothesis Zone
```yaml
FailureAI:
  suspected_root: fastener_B-72xM12
  rationale: localized shear pattern + mounting distortion
  confidence: 73%
```

### Step 3: Gauntlet Simulation
Run local Gauntlet with torque variance, under-grade material, and temperature variance:
```yaml
scenario:
  bolt_grade: 8.8
  torque_applied: 68Nm
  ambient_temp: 42C
result:
  failure_type: shear
  match: 97% to observed breakage
```

### Step 4: BOMBE Ripple Trace
```yaml
ripple_trace:
  origin: fastener_B-72xM12
  affected:
    - component_Y (slip)
    - support_brace_Z (misalignment)
    - frame_node_A (buckling)
```

### Step 5: Enigma Root Cause Audit
```yaml
audit_result:
  expected_grade: 10.9
  used_grade: 8.8
  torque_error: -27Nm
  cause: assembly step deviation, not approved
  status: confirmed_root_cause
  collapse_chain: validated
```

## Twin Output
- Full snapshot of failure twin state
- YAML report of ripple effects and breach
- Comparison to original intent tree
- Optional automated design patch recommendation

---

## Benefits
- Rapid failure tracing
- Legal/audit-grade traceability
- Design logic correction system-wide
- Prevents repetition of same logic drift

---

## Final Thought
Failures don’t have to be mysteries.  
ACT turns every broken part into a lesson — not with guesses, but with logic.  
Reconstruct the past. Protect the future.
