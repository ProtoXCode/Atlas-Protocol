# Atlas Protocol Blueprint Module: ForgeLink – CAM Output and Machine Code Integration

## Overview
ForgeLink is the CAM module within Atlas Protocol that translates part intent and twin geometry into machine-executable code. It allows direct export to supported CNC, robotic, and manufacturing hardware — without requiring external CAM programming. Output is tied directly to the version-controlled twin, ensuring traceability and constraint compliance.

## Intent
To fully automate the conversion of validated twin designs into ready-to-run machine programs. By embedding operation logic, tooling metadata, and jig configurations, ForgeLink eliminates traditional manual CAM programming.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Twin-Based Operation Extraction
- Pull operations directly from part logic and geometry:
  - Hole drilling
  - Contour milling
  - Slotting, profiling, facing
- Constraints and features define paths — no manual sketching required

### 2. Machine Profile Compatibility
- Supports digital twin of target machines or shell model with known parameters:
  - Axis limits
  - Spindle type, tool holders
  - Fixturing constraints
- Can validate if part is manufacturable *on that machine*

### 3. Jig and Fixture Declaration
- Select from predefined jig configurations or auto-generate constraints
- Fixture position affects toolpath origin, collision check, and clamping strategy

### 4. Tooling Metadata Integration
- Links to tooling library (shared or machine-specific)
- Pulls feed rates, RPM, material profiles, tool geometry
- Warns of unsupported operations if tooling is insufficient

## Export Flow

```text
1. Select twin part or assembly
2. Choose "Export to Machine"
3. Select machine profile (or auto-detect from production environment)
4. Confirm jig/fixture configuration
5. Output:
    - G-code / machine-specific format
    - Tool list
    - Setup sheet (optional)
    - Operation metadata tags (Enigma link)
```

## Example

**Input Twin:** Mounting_Bracket_v13  
**Machine:** HAAS VF-2 (Vertical 3-axis mill)  
**Material:** 6061-T6 Aluminum  
**Fixture:** Vise with soft jaws

**ForgeLink Output:**
- 3-axis G-code file
- Tool list: 6mm end mill, center drill, 10mm drill
- Setup instruction: Offset G54, origin back-left corner
- Enigma ID: `a3cf2d92`

## Twin Benefits
- Removes delay between design approval and production
- CAM is no longer a manual bottleneck
- Ensures traceability of all machine instructions to the original logic
- Compatible with ripple feedback (if a part is edited, CAM auto-updates)

---

## Potential Enhancements
- Post-processor builder for uncommon machine languages
- CNC simulation preview with stress/deformation overlays
- Auto-select tooling based on cost/emission/availability (Caladan tie-in)
- 5-axis and additive path generation

---

## Final Thought
ForgeLink turns the Atlas twin into a self-manufacturing system. No middleman. No guesswork. Just logic → geometry → machine code.
