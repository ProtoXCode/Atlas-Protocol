# Atlas Protocol Blueprint Module: Caladan – Global Material Awareness Layer

## Overview
Caladan is the material intelligence module within Atlas Protocol. It continuously monitors global availability, production, and distribution of raw materials, using real-world data (EPDs, shipping manifests, export volumes) to detect supply disruptions and proactively inform design decisions.

---

## Intent
To give the Atlas system real-time, location-aware insight into material risks, enabling design adaptation based on availability, cost volatility, geopolitical tension, and sustainability metrics.

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Dual-Sided Material Chain Analysis**
- Trace supply chains from both directions:
  - *Bottom-up:* From EPDs and raw material origin (e.g., mine output, regional productivity)
  - *Top-down:* From known material usage in existing ERP BOMs and twin constraints
- Match convergence to assess risk exposure and substitution pathways

### 2. **Regional Sensitivity Mapping**
- Assign geolocation to all materials via EPD or supplier data
- Track:
  - Political risk (e.g., war, sanctions)
  - Environmental disruption (e.g., droughts, earthquakes)
  - Export bans or logistical blocks
- Visualize impact zones and threat heatmaps for key resources

### 3. **Ripple-Aware Material Substitution**
- When disruption is detected:
  - Trigger design revision proposals using available substitutes
  - Propagate material switch through parts that can accommodate alternatives
  - Highlight affected parts for review or automatic update by BOMBE

## ERP & Twin Integration
- Material origin linked directly to ERP items or twin part metadata
- Relay cross-checks BOMs against current Caladan feed
- Enables real-time safety stock alerts and purchase recommendation based on unfolding scenarios

---

## Twin Benefits
- Proactive design resilience
- Stock and cost prediction linked to real-world flow
- Instant risk detection with fallback logic
- BOMs and inventory become dynamic, globally aware structures

---

## Potential Enhancements
- Predictive model training from historical disruption events
- Integration with satellite-based export volume estimation
- Live shipping data parsing (AIS, port manifests)
- Industry-specific tuning (e.g., copper in EV, grain-aligned steel in transformers)

---

## Final Thought
Designing with material knowledge is no longer optional — it’s inevitable. Caladan makes the global resource chain visible, reactive, and resilient within the design intent itself.
